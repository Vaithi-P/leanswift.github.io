Once the user is created, it can also be edited by clicking on the &#39;Edit&#39; option. On clicking the &#39;Edit&#39; option, the user details are pre populated. Admin can make changes to the details and save. Once it is saved a success message will be displayed and new changes will be applicable.

Once a new user is created, a reset password email is sent to their mail id. Users can click the reset password link and enter a new password. Once a user sets his password he can login into the frontend using the email address and password. The list of available menus and pages are based on the permissions provided to the user. The sub accounts created by Supplier will have the Supplier ID mapped in the backend.
