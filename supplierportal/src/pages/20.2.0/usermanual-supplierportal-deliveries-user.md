_Note:_
- _When Delivery date is different but the delivery number is the same , a new record with the same delivery number and a different delivery date is added._
- _When a Delivery name and Delivery date is the same , all the lines advised with the delivery note are added as lines and when we try to advise a line with different planned pick up date , the following error message is shown ‘Shipment Advise is not allowed. Delivery note XXX is already advised with shipment date XXYYMM’_
